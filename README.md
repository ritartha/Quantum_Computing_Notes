In order to understand how computers work, we looked at bits. We then used logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) to build circuits, which in turn make up the computer you are using currently. In the first module, we were introduced to spin-qubits via the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Now, we will use similar concepts and using quantum logic gates to build quantum circuits, which in turn would make up your quantum computer. In other words, a quantum logic gate is used to manipulate quantum information (the quantum state of a qubit or a collection of qubits) to enable us to perform tasks that require using concepts of superposition and measurement.

There are three parts of a quantum circuit.
<ul>
    <li><b>Wires</b>. Wires carry qubits from place to place.</li>
<li><b>Gates</b>. Gates do things to qubits. </li>
<li><b>Measurements</b>. These measure qubits, just like the magnets and blockers in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. </li>
</ul>

Below is an example of quantum circuits. The animation shows a system with three different types of quantum gates: a Hadamard Gate (H), then a controlled NOT gate, and then a SWAP gate. You will get a chance to explore more of what each gate does in future expercises.
